# Report Cards

## Standard Report Cards

Those labeled `Report Card School Abbreviation` are the standard report cards and contain logic to display the proper report card term based off the term abbreviations `S1`, `S2`, `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`, and `Q4`. `S1` and `S2` are used by SHS and CF. While the Qs are used by LPO.

## Glorified Progress Reports

The "Report Cards" labeled `Report Card Q1 Q3 School Abbrviation` are simply progress reports with title changed to read `Quarter 1` or `Quarter 3` repot card. SHS and CF both don't store grades for their Quarter Report cards as they are similar to that of a snapshot of where a student is in their grade for the semester. Ideal use would be the schools moving away from sending anything out phrased `report card` for any non-stored grade however this is a bigger ask. They are stored in this secition to reduce possible confusion, any logic changes in the grade section should also be made in the corresponding `Progress Report` located in the `Progress Report` Folder.

## Grade Logic Chaos in report cards for SHS

There is a lot of logic involved with all SHS report cards due to the nature of how the school sets up its classes with classes that span multiple periods. Fixing how this is approached by the school hopefully will be addressed eventually. This however makes the report cards slightly more clean.
