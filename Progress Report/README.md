# Progress Reports

## School Specific

Due to the inability to switch between different logos and text color based on logic, each school gets it's own report system.

## Grade and Comment chaos, specifically in `Progress Report SHS`

In `Progress Report SHS` there is a lot of logic in place due to the setup of the classes at the school, specifically with the ability for classes to be two periods on the same day. A more simplified approach can be see in in `Progress Report CF` and `Progress Report LPO`.
