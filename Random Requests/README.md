# Random Requests

These requests don't fall under other more specific folders. Kind of a junk drawer of reports.

## Students - ID and Access Codes

Made for teachers to be able to pull up their students username (email) and password. Likely not best practice due to chance of teacher leaving out in the open but keeps things straight forward and easy for the teacher in the middle of a technology involved lesson.

## Teacher Grade Checks - LPO

Made for front office staff, in this case specifically LPO to be able to check that a student has a grade from a teacher. Similar to a progress check but is done to check syncing and that grades are coming through correctly.
